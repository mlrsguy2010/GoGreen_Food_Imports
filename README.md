# GoGreen_Food_Imports
Business Intelligence project

This project was a collaborative effort that our team built from April 2023 to June 2023. This project served as the capstone project for our B.A.S program at Bellevue College.

The scenario behind the project is that the team was hired by GoGreen Food Imports, which was a startup company focused on importing sustainable food products. Our team was responsible for conducting exploratory data analysis in order to provide business intelligence insights to our stakeholders.

This project featured all of the major components of a Business Intelligence project: Data acquisition, data cleansing, data warehouse design, ETL into the data warehouse, exploratory data analysis, and data visualization.
Our team used the Agile/SCRUM project management methodology to coordinate our work flow. The results of our work were presented to an audience of fellow students, professors, and data industry professionals.

I have included the data warehouse schema script and the data load script in the repository. These scripts are meant for SQL Server Management Studio 2021 and SQL Server 2021.

I would also like to thank my fellow contributors and team members: Oanh Bunas, Heather Selymes, Jodi Thomas, and Xia Zhang.
